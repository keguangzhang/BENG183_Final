# Ribosome Profiling

## Procedures
**DNA library Preparation**    
Similar to RNA-seq, the preparation of ribosome profiling libraries requires cell lysis, mRNA purification, and reverse transcription. Here's an overview of the steps:
1) We need to freeze the translation in cells before lysing. The cells can be treated with elongation inhibitor, such as cycloheximide, which was suspected to block the E site of ribosome so that the tRNA in the P site can't translocate itself to the E site. To interrogate the initiation site of translation, the cells should be treated with harringtonine, which causes the ribosomes to accumulate at initiation codons. After appropriate treatements, the cell should new be ready to be lysed by lysis reagents. For animal-derived samples, such as tissues that need to be physically disrupted,
