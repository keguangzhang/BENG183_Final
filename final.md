# Ribosome Profiling

## Procedures
**DNA library Preparation**    
Similar to RNA-seq, the preparation of ribosome profiling libraries requires cell lysis, mRNA purification, and reverse transcription. Here's an overview of the steps:
1) We first need to freeze the translation in cells before lysing them by treating them with elongation inhibitors, such as cycloheximide. To interrogate the initiation site of translation, the cells should be treated with harringtonine, which would cause the ribosomes to accumulate at initiation codons. 
2) After appropriate treatments, the cell should now be ready to be lysed by lysis reagents. For animal-derived samples, such as tissues that need to be physically disrupted, it is a robust approach to cryogenically pulverize the tissues and then thaw the tissues in the translation inhibitors. Note that these first two steps may vary depending on the types of samples and species.
3) Nuclease would then be used to digest regions on mRNA that are not protected by ribosomes. 
4) Next, an ultracentrifuge needs to be performed to spin down and separate the mRNA-ribosome complex with the naked mRNA. The ribosomes would then be washed off the mRNA.
