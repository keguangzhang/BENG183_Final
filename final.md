# Ribosome Profiling

## Procedures
**DNA library Preparation**    
Similar to RNA-seq, the preparation of ribosome profiling libraries requires cell lysis, mRNA purification, and reverse transcription. Here's an overview of the steps:
1) We need to freeze the translation in cells before lysing. The cells can be treated with elongation inhibitor, such as cycloheximide, which would
