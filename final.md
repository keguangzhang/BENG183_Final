# Ribosome Profiling

## Procedures
**DNA library Preparation**    
Similar to RNA-seq, the preparation of ribosome profiling libraries requires cell lysis, mRNA purification, and reverse transcription. Here's an overview of the steps:
1) We need to freeze the translation in cells before lysing. The cells can be treated with elongation inhibitor, such as cycloheximide, which was suspected to block the E site of ribosome so that the tRNA in the P site can't translocate itself to the E site. To interrogate the initiation site of translation, the cells should be treated with harringtonine, which causes the ribosomes to accumulate at initiation codons.
