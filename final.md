# Ribosome Profiling

## Procedures
**DNA library Preparation**    
Similar to RNA-seq, the preparation of ribosome profiling libraries requires cell lysis, mRNA purification, and reverse transcription. Here's an overview of the steps:
1) We first need to freeze the translation in cells before lysing them by treating them with elongation inhibitors, such as cycloheximide. To interrogate the initiation site of translation, the cells should be treated with harringtonine, which would cause the ribosomes to accumulate at initiation codons. 
2) After appropriate treatments, the cell should now be ready to be lysed by lysis reagents. For animal-derived samples, such as tissues that need to be physically disrupted, it is a robust approach to cryogenically pulverize the tissues and then thaw the tissues in the translation inhibitors. Note that these first two steps may vary depending on the types of samples and species.
3) Nuclease would then be used to digest regions on mRNA that are not protected by ribosomes. 
4) Next, an ultracentrifuge needs to be performed to spin down and separate the mRNA-ribosome complex with the naked mRNA. The ribosomes would then be washed off the mRNA.
The mRNA sequences are now obtained. The next steps are to sequence them.
5) Linker sequences would first be ligated to the 3â€™ end of the mRNA fragments.
6) Reverse transcriptase and primers would then be added to perform a reverse transcription.
7) Among the cDNA reverse transcription products, many are rRNA contamination that needed to be eliminated by hybridizing them with biotinylated sense strand oligonucleotides and then treating with streptavidin which would bind to the biotin. Note that contamination may be still present after this step, further elimination of this contamination would need to be done in the later bioinformatics data analysis.
8) The rest of the cDNA would next be PCR amplified to create a ribosome footprint library.

**Data Analysis**
The bioinformatics data analysis of ribosome profiling has many overlaps with that of RNA-seq, and many pipelines and packages have been established for different analysis purposes.
